## [0.1.0] - 2024-11-06
This is inital release of the findflare module, there might be some major changes depending on my current project directions.

## TODO
-- 2024-11-19
* Implement a method for rejecting the flares detected near datagaps and near start and stop of the observations, as lightcurves can drift causing a false flare detection.
